            <div className={styles.sectionTitle}>The Princess of Night</div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                Ellowyn was a winged, dark elf princess in a time where war ravaged the human world.
                Kingdoms fought for land and resources, and with the might of dragons at their aid, were able
                to fight impossible battles that would span lifetimes in the matter of moments.
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                Ellowyn was born with very special talents. She was able to fly at birth with wings of a dark blue hue.  Her
                skin was of a lighter blue with ringlets of scales elegantly adorning her features.  She had very long, jet
                black hair that would almost touch the ground had it not been set in curl.  At a very young age, she 
                would fly amongst the dragons in the sky and share nests until early morning when she'd return home.
                Her mother, Marmane, would always criticize her for coming home so late, but it never stopped her from
                taking flight and being with her winged friends the very next day.
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                She loved the night sky.  So many colors and sounds, especially during war times, would dance all around her.
                In the distance, she could see flaming balls of tar-covered stone being hurled from catapults against a castle’s 
                walls, or see the light of fire reflecting off of a waterfall from a nearby spring.  Often times, dragons were 
                spewing fire from their lips upon squadrons of soldiers on the ground.  When there was no war, the moon lit 
                everything in a calm, serene nightscape that sent chills down her back, almost like a tiny embrace from nature itself.
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                The night was Ellowyn’s favorite time of the whole day.  That is when all of the dragons came out to play.  They flew
                high and low, circling and spiraling almost in cadence to the wind hissing amongst the trees. 
                So many dragons would come out to play that the air seemed cluttered and crowded.  Ellowyn felt as if she was almost 
                part dragon herself, for she believed that she could hear them speak to her.
            </div>
            <div className={styles.sectionTitle}>The Awakening</div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                Since near birth, Ellowyn often spent time with dragons at their nests, but she’d always return home to finally sleep.  
                She’d spend time playing with the baby dragons and watching them eat and cuddle with their mothers.  Ellowyn was 
                almost as long in body as a baby dragon with a wingspan that would make any dragon blush.  She was 15 years old now, 
                almost to turn 16… her birthday only a few days away.
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                On her birthday, she would be married to a neighboring village’s prince.  She had never met this prince, and was reluctant 
                to the thought of having to marry someone she did not love.  This was a right of passage to princes of the dark elf race 
                that had been going on for centuries.  Nobody had ever stood up against it, or at least, lived to tell about it.
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                On the night before her 16th birthday, Ellowyn took her usual flight into the night sky to spend time with the dragons.  
                She flew up into the chilly night air and in a sudden, a bright golden streak of light connected with her. 
                The night sky was ablaze in a fiery yellow hue.
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                “You shall not marry the prince of Handaru.  You will become our queen and live with us until the war of man ends.”
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                The voice came from nowhere.  Dragons were dancing in the night wind, but Ellowyn distinctly heard these words as if 
                it were from someone right in front of her.
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                All of a sudden, another fiery light came afoot and lit against her shoulder.  Soon, a mark appeared of two swirling 
                dragons against the moonlight seared into her skin.  It was done.  She had become… dragonkin.
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                Like a bolt of lightning, she shot up to the highest peaks of the trees and shouted, “I shall be your queen, and with me, 
                we shall tear the bloodshed of mankind from its inexplicable dream!”
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                And just as she rose, she fell into a deep sleep.  The dragons escorted her to her home and left her on the balcony of 
                her tree hut.  The day of her birthday and wedding had passed without her eyes opening once.  The King was furious, and 
                at a loss, for he had not understood what had happened to his daughter.  The wedding was postponed.  The prince of Handaru 
                came and left without speaking a single word.
            </div>
            <div className={styles.sectionTitle}>This Brutal War</div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                A famine had been plaguing the castle city of Verbinas for months.  Orcs to the south of the city had been killing off the livestock 
                at night and attacking the nearby wildlife.  This was unusual for the orcs though, as savage as they can be.  Harsh weather had also 
                dried up most of the vegetation, so no crops were producing.  It was a very hard time, indeed.
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                The simplest solution, the king thought, would be to raid a neighboring city and loot its goods, and perhaps “hire” some help… 
                nothing like a few hired minions to tend the gardens to lift the spirits of those in need.
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                The time arose and the king spoke: “My family, the kingdom of Verbinas!  We shall conquer Cequinnas, harvest its goods, and 
                return to a state of godliness!”  The king gathered back into his throne as pledges of worship arose and with a small grin caressed 
                between his lips he cried,  “CALL THE DRAGONS!
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                Any fruitful nation had dragons.  Your nation couldn’t win a war without a dragon in these times.  Verbinas had 3 dragons, 
                and a dragonkin (a person that can speak to dragons).  His name was Persellus.  Persellus was 11 years old, but by blood, a noble 
                heir to his father to be a dragonkin to the king.
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                Persellus was always eager to show off his abilities to the king.  This day brought him much joy.  At the age of 11, there wasn’t 
                much to do around the castle, and talking to dragons just to talk to dragons wasn’t something Persellus did.  He was often bored.  
                Today, he would get to command dragons!
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                The city of Cequinnas was cast in a brilliant blue as night fell upon it.  It had no disturbance in food source or any wars to be 
                heard of.  It was quiet… its diligent dragons circling above just in case of danger approaching.
            </div>
            <div className={styles.sectionTitle}>She Sleeps No More</div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                All of sudden, thousands of men come rushing through the trees and the shrieking of dragons are in the air.
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                Ellowyn awakes from her slumber.  In a flash, she spreads her brilliant wings and flutters to the roof.  Her eyes are on fire.  T
                hey burned a brilliant yellow flash.  When she speaks, the air reverberates.  “IT’S TIME!”
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                Ellowyn’s mother and father watch as she streaks into the sky faster than anything they’ve ever seen move before in awe.  Within only a 
                few minutes, Ellowyn is at the battle of Cequinnas.
            </div>
            <div className={styles.sectionTitle}>The Fighting Ensues</div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                As the forces encircle the city, flames can be seen all around.  Dragon upon dragon were spewing fire from their fangs in a vicious battle.  
                The footmen had no defense against the arial attack, but they persisted none-the-less.
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                Men and dragon alike were attacking each other fiercely.  Sword against sword, bows and arrows blazing, men battled to the death.  Dragons 
                would spew fire at large groups of men, incinerating them instantly.  It was a gruesome battle.
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                Ellowyn looked on at the battle and felt a great need to stop it at once!  “Dragons!  Do not let these human fools control you!  Come to me 
                and let this battle be done!”
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                All at once, all the dragons stopped fighting and flew to Ellowyn’s side.  Both armies, in total confusion, looked blankly at each other 
                and stopped fighting to try to figure out what was going on.  Persellus was upset that he had lost control of the dragons he was charged with.  
                He kept calling to them, but they would not listen to his words.
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                Ellowyn flew down to where the armies stood, the dragons following her to the ground.  She spoke to them.  “People!  This war is one that 
                needs not take place.  The people of Verbinas simply require food for there crops are all withered and there is no meat to be had.”  The Cequinnas 
                army, sheathed their blades and began to march to the gate of their great city and beckoned the Verbinas army to follow them.  Ellowyn followed them 
                along with the dragons.
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                As everyone entered the city, the commander of the Cequinnas army offered as much food as the Verbinas army could carry.  They loaded up food on 
                the backs of their dragons and filled their arms with as much food as they could carry.  As they were about to leave, they offered great thanks to 
                their newly-found friends and were off to begin their journey back home.  
            </div>
            <div className={styles.sectionTitle}>The Return Home</div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                Ellowyn returns to her mother and father.  “King, Queen, I have something to tell you.”, she says.
            </div>
            <div className={classes.stanza}>
                She shows in a deep yellow glow, showing off her brilliant blue color.  “I am dragonkin.  I walk amongst dragons now.  I speak with 
                them, I hear them, I command them.  They are now my children.”  Ellowyn explains on and on how the ritual happened and how she has 
                become queen of all dragons, and to the disbelief of her parents, she has risen above the sacred law of the people.  She is not to be 
                married, but to remain queen of the dragons!
